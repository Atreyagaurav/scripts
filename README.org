* Scripts files
  This repo contains small scripts I have written for various tasks, some still work, some are under development and some I have abandoned.

  The summary of scripts are in following table, you can refer to specific section for full details.
  
  | Script name  | File name       | language | Short description             |
  | [[Autocomplete]] | autocomplete.py | python   | Autocomplete frequent phrases |
  |              |                 |          |                               |

* Autocomplete
  /Abandoned project/

  Basically saves a json of phrases you use frequently and then you can use them.

  I'm planning to update this one using Dmenu, with two script options
  - Add new phrase
  - Insert phrase

  I'll probably rewrite it on bash if I do it again.
